# shopping-cart

[Project Description]
    (https://github.com/prof-rossetti/intro-to-python/blob/master/projects/shopping-cart/README.md)
# Set up and run the app
Create repository, MAKE SURE TO ADD README, clone to computer. Afterwards, create a file with produvts in shopping_cart.py, create virtual environment, y, then activate.
# You are ready to code! 
# Have the user input a product identifier
Have the user input an id
Using the input function, require that the user inputs a number by writing "please enter a product identifyer"
# Make sure an ID prints out a list
    When the user inserts a product identifier, the program should output a list. This list will correspond with the product list providing the directions of the projects. 
    Take the format of the list from (https://github.com/prof-rossetti/intro-to-python/blob/master/notes/python/datatypes/lists.md)
    Use the filtering list syntax under # using a list comprehension

# Make the list make sense
    The way the list is set up doesn't apply to the code we are creating. Instead of team put p for product and put id for city. Make sure you put selected_id for the last "city" txt 
    Then print the matching product

# The computer is dumb, make the product equal a string
    Make the program print the string that is associated with the id by putting str before it.

# Look Up Product Name  
    Now that the product can connect numbers and products using str, let make the 

# Start a loop
    Put "while" and then the input code under it indented

# Done
    If statement: If id is "Done" then or (:) break or (else) products

# Total Price
    To make the program print out the total price, define the variable BEFORE THE LOOP
    Then make the program print out the total price after the loop
    Make sure that you make the program calculate the total price in additional to the matching_product["price"]
